# JavaScript for React ‚Äì Practice & Examples

Welcome to my JavaScript learning repo!

This repository contains my personal notes, exercises, and examples from JavaScript sessions aimed at building a solid foundation before diving deeper into React.

## üìÅ Folder Structure

- **`exercises/`**  
  My self-evaluation exercises completed after each JavaScript session. These helped me reflect on and reinforce what I learned.

- **`JS/`**  
  JavaScript example files from sessions with my lecturer. These served as practical demonstrations of key JavaScript concepts.

- **`index.html`**  
  A simple HTML file used to load and run the JavaScript examples interactively in the browser.

## üí° Purpose

This repo documents my learning journey with JavaScript. It was created to help me:
- Practice core JS concepts before jumping into React
- Organize examples and experiments in one place
- Track progress and easily revisit previous topics
